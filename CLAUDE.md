# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A shared GitHub Actions library providing reusable Claude-powered automation. Consumers add a single caller workflow to their repo; this library handles the job logic.

## Linting

Workflow files are linted with `actionlint` on every push and PR via `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. Run locally before pushing:

```bash
brew install actionlint  # macOS
actionlint               # from repo root
```

There are no other build steps, tests, or package managers — this is a pure GitHub Actions project.

## Architecture

Every capability ships in two forms:

| Form | Location | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Reusable workflow | `.github/workflows/claude-*.yml` | Simplest consumer experience — one `uses:` line |
| Composite action | `<name>/action.yml` | Embed as a step inside a larger job |

The reusable workflows are thin wrappers that delegate to the composite actions (same pattern as `apply-fix.yml` → `./apply-fix`). Logic lives in the composite action; the workflow just provides the trigger context, permissions, and concurrency blocks.

**Why absolute refs, not relative paths:** Reusable workflows reference composite actions via `cbeaulieu-gt/github-actions/<action>@v1` (not `./action`). Relative `./` paths break for external consumers because `actions/checkout@v4` replaces the runner workspace with the consumer's repo — `./tag-claude` then points into the consumer's repo, not this library. Absolute refs let GitHub resolve the action directly from this repo's tree without a local checkout.

**Dogfooding limitation:** GitHub Actions does not support expressions in `uses:` values, so a conditional `@main` vs `@v1` reference is not possible. PRs opened against this repo will test composite actions at the released `@v1` tag, not the local branch's composite action changes. To validate a composite action change before release, test it in an external consumer repo pointing at the branch.

### Actions

- **`pr-review/`** — Reviews PRs via `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`. On `synchronize` events, diffs only the new commits (`git diff before..after`) and escalates to a full review if foundational code is touched.
- **`tag-claude/`** — Responds to `@claude` mentions. Delegates to `./check-auth` first, then calls `claude-code-action` only if authorized.
- **`check-auth/`** — Authorization primitive. Outputs `authorized=true/false` based on an explicit `authorized_users` allowlist (takes precedence) or `github.event.comment.author_association` (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR). Used by `tag-claude/`.
- **`apply-fix/`** — Validates a unified diff against protected paths (rejects anything touching `.github/`), applies it with `git apply`, commits, and pushes to the PR branch.
- **`lint-failure/`** — Diagnoses lint failures on a PR via `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`. Fetches failed lint logs and PR diff, posts a structured `## Claude Lint Diagnosis` comment, and optionally commits a fix when `auto_apply: true`.

### CI automation workflows

- **`ci-failure.yaml`** — Triggered by `workflow_run` on CI failure. Fetches plain-text logs via `gh run view --log-failed`, writes them to `/tmp/ci_logs.txt`, calls `claude-code-action` to diagnose and optionally auto-apply a fix.
- **`apply-fix.yml`** — `workflow_dispatch` wrapper around `./apply-fix` for manual invocation.
- **`claude-lint-fix.yml`** — `workflow_call`-only wrapper around `./lint-failure`. Consumers add a `notify-claude` job (with `needs: [lint]` and `if: failure()`) to their lint workflow.

## Key conventions

**Permissions must be declared at the workflow level** (not job level) in caller workflows. GitHub ignores job-level permissions when calling reusable workflows. `pull_request` events default to `pull-requests: none` and `contents: read` — both must be explicitly granted.

**Token selection for `claude-code-action`:** Use `github_token: ${{ github.token }}` for read-only operations (PR review, tag responses). Use `github_token: ${{ inputs.gh_pat }}` (or the PAT secret) when `claude-code-action` must push commits — GitHub suppresses `synchronize` events for pushes authenticated with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the PAT is required to re-trigger downstream workflows like `pr-review`.

**Composite action inputs are always strings** — there is no `type` field. Boolean inputs like `require_association` arrive as the string `'true'`/`'false'` and must be compared with `[ "$VAR" = "true" ]`.

**Authorization step outputs gate downstream steps** — `exit 0` inside a composite action step does not prevent subsequent steps from running. Use a step output (`authorized=true/false` → `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`) and `if: steps.authz.outputs.authorized == 'true'` on each downstream step.

**`shellcheck disable=SC2016`** is required on `run:` blocks that contain `${{ }}` expressions inside single-quoted strings — shellcheck treats these as unintended non-expansion, but GitHub Actions pre-processes them before the shell sees the string.

## Versioning

- `v1.7.1` — pinned tag for reproducible builds
- `v1` — floating tag, always points to latest `v1.x.x`

When changes are released: move both `v1` and the new `v1.x.x` tag to the latest main HEAD and force-push both tags. Create a GitHub release against `v1.x.x`.

## Required secrets

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | All `claude-code-action` invocations |
| `GH_PAT` | `ci-failure.yaml` and `apply-fix` (needs `contents:write` + `pull-requests:read`); `lint-failure` (needs `Actions: read` + `contents:write` + `pull-requests:write`) |
